# CPU_schedular:
# Project Description:
-A CPU scheduler is an essential part of an operating system that manages process execution. It determines which process will use the CPU and for what duration, aiming to maximize resource efficiency. By employing various algorithms and policies, it balances factors such as throughput, response time, and fairness to enhance overall system performance. Essentially, the CPU scheduler functions as a traffic controller for the CPU, directing the flow of processes to ensure smooth operation.
